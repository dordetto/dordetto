### Hello Folks! :smiley:

My name is Fabio Dordetto do Brasil (🇧🇷). I have been working with I.T. since 1996 and currently I have been learning codes like javascript and its entire universe like ReacJs, React Native, Node.Js and counting...

In my free time, I like to be with my friends to have good conversations. Beer (🍺) and a good *Churrasco* (:meat_on_bone:) help us.

Find me at:
