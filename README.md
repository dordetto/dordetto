### Hello Folks! :smiley:

My name is Fabio Dordetto from Brazil :brazil: in Canada :canada:. I have been working with I.T. since 1996, and currently, I have been working with javascript and its entire universes like ReacJs, Vue, React Native, Node.Js and counting...

In my free time, I like to be with my friends having a good talk when drinks (:beer: :tropical_drink:) and a good *Churrasco* (:meat_on_bone:) helps.

Find me at:
